## Pure Pursuit Model (PPM) – Fighter vs Bomber Simulation
This project is a graphical simulation of a fighter aircraft chasing a bomber using the Pure Pursuit Model (PPM). Implemented entirely in Java Swing (JFrame + JPanel), it visualizes how a pursuing entity (fighter) can intercept a moving target (bomber) by constantly adjusting its heading toward the target’s real-time position.
